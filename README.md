# TheHyperdimensionalTransform_applications

This repository supports the article "The Hyperdimensional Transform For Distributional Modelling, Regression and Classification" using the Julia programming language.

The folder BasicTutorial contains a basic general introduction to the hyperdimensional transform. It contains a notebook in the julia laguage (julia 1.6.2) in ipynb, html and pdf version.

For each figure and table in the article, the repository contains a corresponding folder with the name starting with Fig or Tab allowing the reader to reproducing the articles results. Each of these folders contains a julia notebook .ipynb (julia 1.6.2) with computations and the figures made for the article (note that the guides for many of the plots are often generated in separete figures).
